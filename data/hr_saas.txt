SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
The HR SaaS platform is a modern, cloud-hosted system designed to streamline the full employee lifecycle. It supports organizations by centralizing employee data, automating repetitive tasks, improving compliance, and providing actionable workforce analytics. The platform is accessible across browsers and mobile devices. It eliminates on-premise maintenance and ensures real-time updates, global accessibility, and improved scalability.

The platform integrates with ERP systems, identity providers, finance systems, learning platforms, email providers, and more.
